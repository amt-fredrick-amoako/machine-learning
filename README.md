A. Unveiling Machine Learning
Core Concepts of Machine Learning

Supervised Learning: Involves training a model on labeled data (emails tagged as "spam" or "not spam").
Algorithms for Spam Filtering:
Na√Øve Bayes: Often used for text classification problems like spam filtering.
Logistic Regression: Works well for binary classification.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): Effective for text data classification.
Decision Trees/Random Forests: Can handle complex decision boundaries.
Integration into an Email Application

Data Collection: Store labeled email data in a database or a file system.
Model Training: Train the machine learning model using historical data.
Model Deployment: Use the trained model to classify new emails.
Pipeline:
Preprocess incoming emails (tokenization, removing stop words, etc.).
Convert emails into numerical features (e.g., term frequency-inverse document frequency - TF-IDF).
Pass the processed email to the model for classification.
